<b>Developing intuitive user interfaces for the analysis of genome data</b>


Current research in biology and medicine often requires advanced computational analyses. A team of computer scientists, statisticians and biologists located here in Oslo have over the last five years been developing a system for statistical analysis of genome data (Hyperbrowser - http://hyperbrowser.uio.no/hb/ ). This is a public, web-based system that allows researchers in biology and medicine to specify advanced hypotheses related to e.g. the human genome through a set of standard selection boxes on a web page. A strength of the system is that it treats the genomic data in an abstract manner, thus allowing hypotheses related to a range of topics in biology and medicine to be handled by the same interface and underlying methodology. At the same time, this is also a main drawback of the system: by requiring users to think about their concrete biological/medical question in an abstract manner, the system may be difficult to use, especially for new users. In addition, some of the innocent looking selection boxes on the web page represent advanced statistical concepts, presenting a further challenge for usability.
